💯 INTERVIEW QUESTION

1. Is console.log method same, when we write console.log is browser and in node terminal ❓

Ans: No, because when we use console.log in chrome console window and print javascript code, it works because, it is function of the browser.
but In node, we don't have any browser, so node js create internally module provides a simple debugging console.
That is similar to the JavaScript console mechanism provided by web browsers.

A Console class with methods such as console.log(), console.error(), and console.warn() that can be used to write to any Node.js stream.
