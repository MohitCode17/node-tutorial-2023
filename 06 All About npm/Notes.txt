What is NPM ?

Npm stands for Node Package Manager. It is a package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. Npm is known as the world's largest software registry. Open-source developers all over the world use npm to publish and share their source code.

We can use NPM packages in our files. Basic difference between Node core module and NPM modules that they created by third parties.


What is Package.Json file ?

The package. json file is the heart of any Node project. It records important metadata about a project which is required before publishing to NPM, and also defines functional attributes of a project that npm uses to install dependencies, run scripts, and identify the entry point to our package.

- description: Anything
- entry point: root file (index.js)
- git repository:
